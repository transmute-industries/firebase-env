### environment.secret.env

### dapp

This folder contains a create react app with Transmute Framework. It is the template used for:

```
transmute init .
```

This command create a new dapp with cloud functions and transmute framework in a directory. 

See its readme for more. 

### Developing .transmute

You'll need to rebuild .transmute from some stored secret directory often when testing configuration changes.

```
yarn transmute setup --reset --from ~/Code/secrets/.transmute/
```

### Testing apps that use .transmute

Once you have setup a .transmute, it will be used by init.

```
rm -rf ../smoke/dapp/ && yarn transmute init ../smoke/
```

### Full dapp rebuild after environments setup

```
yarn transmute setup --reset --from ~/Code/secrets/.transmute/ && rm -rf ../smoke/dapp/ && yarn transmute init ../smoke/
```


### Other commands

```
yarn add global transmute-cli@latest

rm -rf ./dapp
transmute setup --reset
transmute setup 
transmute init .

# cd dapp 
# firebase init 
# yarn install && cd functions && yarn install && cd ..
# NO TO EVERYTHING

# firebase deploy --only functions 
```
